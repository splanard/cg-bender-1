## Want to resolve it by yourself?

Checkout `develop` to start implementing your own solution!

Each test case provided by CodinGame in the puzzle is implemented in the test class `SolutionTest`. You just have to run it in your favorite IDE to see the result of your work.

The `FileBuilder` class comes from [Manwe56 competitive-programming repository](https://github.com/Manwe56/competitive-programming) (thx!). It can be used to aggregate your code into a single file, so that you can submit it in CodinGame IDE.

## Want to discover my solution?

Then please checkout `solution`.

I solved this puzzle as a training for TDD and CleanCode. This might need some more refactoring.
